# ProxyServer
Simple proxy server built using Python 3.

## Instructions on How To Use:
1. Open Terminal; run the following command: 'python3 proxy_server.py'
2. Open Firefox browser and configure browser to run on your localhost and on port 8888
3. In Firefox browser, enter any URL that is the following form: http://www.<rest of domain>. For example, a valid url would be: 'http://www.mit.edu'. An invalid URL would be 'http://index.html'
4. Wait until the website is rendered on the browser; this should coincide when the proxy server returns the response message to the client
